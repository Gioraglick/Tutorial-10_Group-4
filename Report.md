# Executive Summary
This business report has been engaged by a major travel company in order to develop and implement an information system that will improve their in-house call management centre (CMC). This report will highlight the relevant resources needed and the preliminary planning steps involved in the development of the information system. The document will be divided into 7 sections; Objectives, Stakeholders, Design Thinking, Agile Methodology, Assumptions, Work Products and Models, and competitive advantages.

# Objectives
* Design thinking is a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity. Develop an information system to improve the operation on their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC) (Chandran 2020).

* Adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) in order to perform sales (holiday packages)

* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills, performance, product knowledge and customers profiles

* Create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile

* Provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls 

* Ensure the targeting of potential buyers with outbound calls are accurate 

* Segmenting customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames (Utilising the ‘Profiler Tool’)

* Able to create RM profiles; Using the employment 10-minute questionnaire data that is stored

* Ability to route calls, minimising inbound call costs (reducing pre-call handling time) 

* Generate a customer score (Rating of: 1-10), capturing and utilising data such as ‘repeated customers’, ‘postcodes’ to adjust scores

* Ability to redirect customers to an interactive voice response unit during large call inflows

# Define the problem
* The system’s operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company. 

* Customers may hang up the phone if they suffer from a longer wait time than expected.

* Misaligned expectations: Stakeholders might have different visions as to what the software capabilities are. 

* Data Integrity: Ensuring that privacy standards are upheld (No leaking customers personal information).

* Short term decline in productivity during the software implementation stage. Thus, the staff could find it hard to adjust to a new system initially.

# Stakeholders
* Call management Centre (CMC): Main source of transactions and communication. Customer retention and getting new customers 

* Relationship Managers (RM): They ensure sales are performed and ensure continuous transactions are completed. Generate as many sales of holiday packages as possible

* Current customers: Have a vested interest and potential stake in the company. They purchase products through the travel company. The information system will provide assistance to RMs in serving their potential customers and will match RMs and potential customers according to RMs skills and customer profiles. 

* Holiday Suppliers: They are stakeholders as it is their product being sold. The call centre is just the intermediary, therefore they have a vested interest.

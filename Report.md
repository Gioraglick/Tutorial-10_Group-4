# Executive Summary
This business report has been engaged by a major travel company in order to develop and implement an information system that will improve their in-house call management centre (CMC). This report will highlight the relevant resources needed and the preliminary planning steps involved in the development of the information system. The document will be divided into 7 sections; Objectives, Stakeholders, Design Thinking, Agile Methodology, Assumptions, Work Products and Models, and competitive advantages.

# Objectives

The analysis will allow the Relationship Managers (RM) to ensure fulfilment of objectives as stated by the demands of the travel company. Objectives are outlined as follows:

* Develop an information system to improve the operation on their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC)

* Adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) in order to perform sales (holiday packages)

* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills, performance, product knowledge and customers profiles

* Create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile

* Provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls 

* Ensure the targeting of potential buyers with outbound calls are accurate 

* Segmenting customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames (Utilising the ‘Profiler Tool’)

* Able to create RM profiles; Using the employment 10-minute questionnaire data that is stored

* Ability to route calls, minimising inbound call costs (reducing pre-call handling time) 

* Generate a customer score (Rating of: 1-10), capturing and utilising data such as ‘repeated customers’, ‘postcodes’ to adjust scores

* Ability to redirect customers to an interactive voice response unit during large call inflows

______________________________
# Define the problem
* The system’s operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company. 

* Customers may hang up the phone if they suffer from a longer wait time than expected.

* Misaligned expectations: Stakeholders might have different visions as to what the software capabilities are. 

* Data Integrity: Ensuring that privacy standards are upheld (No leaking customers personal information).

* Short term decline in productivity during the software implementation stage. Thus, the staff could find it hard to adjust to a new system initially. 

_______________________________
# Stakeholders
* Call management Centre (CMC): Main source of transactions and communication. Customer retention and getting new customers 

* Relationship Managers (RM): They ensure sales are performed and ensure continuous transactions are completed. Generate as many sales of holiday packages as possible

* Current customers: Have a vested interest and potential stake in the company. They purchase products through the travel company. The information system will provide assistance to RMs in serving their potential customers and will match RMs and potential customers according to RMs skills and customer profiles. 

* Holiday Suppliers: They are stakeholders as it is their product being sold. The call centre is just the intermediary, therefore they have a vested interest.

# Approach to Design Thinking principles
## Empathise 
Empathise is the first stage of design thinking, gaining an empathetic understanding of the problem our group is attempting to solve. Gaining a deeper understanding of the user will promote the success of the information system implementation, adhering to stakeholder expectations.  In order to achieve this, our group designed an empathy map. Please see below:

### Think & Feel
* Fear of the information system not meeting CMC requirements
* Excitement, RMs get a better system which makes work easier/more efficient
* Nervous to learn how to information works, might be confronting

### Hear
* Heard that other travel companies (competitors) might have a similar system
* Heard that improvements in information systems can boost sales and revenue
* Heard that IT can be tough to learn but is an opportunity to develop new skills

### See
* See customers being unfamiliar with the new system
* See a more efficient call flow rate, RMs performing more sales
* See competitors trying to emulate the company’s new system

### Say & Do
* I want a reliable system that will not need constant maintained
* I don’t understand how the system works and will need to be trained
* I envision the system to a great success, leading to a greater customer experience

### Pain
* The implementation of a new system could be very expensive
* If the system fails, our customers might go to our competitors
* Our customers might not like the new system, and would rather use old one 

### Gain
* Gain a competitive advantage in the travel market  
* Ability to measure RM performance which can be used to monitor employees
* Workers perform more efficiently, selling more products which promotes company profits

## Define 
(CODY TO PLACE HIS DEFINE TABLE HERE)

### How Might We Statements:
* How might we develop and implement an information system that will improve the in-house call management centre’s sales by 15%
* How might we minimise the cost of labour through the information system
* How might we improve the customer’s overall experience with the travel company
* How might we ensure that customer personal data is encrypted/safe
* How might we guarantee that the RM know how to use and operate the new information system

## Ideate 
### WE MET . . . 
* A call centre that was unorganised and overwhelmed with the call flow rate of customers

### WE WERE SURPRISED TO NOTICE . . . 
* The the relationship managers were not matched to the customers correctly (Based on the RM’s skill level and RM profile)

### WE WONDER IF THIS MEANS . . . 
* That there is an opportunity to improve holiday package sales by matching the customers and RMs through a skill matcher

### IT WOULD BE GAME-CHANGING TO . . . 
* Make several day-to-day responsibilities automated through the information system. This would improve the company’s efficiency, so the RMs can have a greater focus on the customer

## Test
Here we rigorously tested the software, evaluating both the staff and customers perspectives and experiences. Additionally, we ran our own diagnostics, evaluating whether the prototype met our technological standards.  Please see the table below:

### Staff Results:
Questions to Staff | Outcome
------------ | -------------
How easy was it to learn the system? | I found it difficult at first, but got the hang of it after a couple hours 
What did you like about the system? | It managed the call flow very well, and it matched me to customers that were aligned with my previous experiences
What did you dislike about the system? | The system was a bit slow to use, there was a bit of delay
How did you feel when you used it? | It made me feel less stressed as calls were managed in a more organised manner
Would you like to continue using it? Why? | Yes, I was able to perform more sales

### Customer Results:
Questions to Staff | Outcome
------------ | -------------
Did you have a good experience? | Yes, the call was quick and there was little waiting time
Were you happy with the salesperson you matched with? | Yes, I matched with someone who was knowledgeable about area I was looking go on holiday
Did you buy the holiday package? | No, I was unsure whether I could afford the holiday I wanted
Would you recommend the travel company to a friend? | Yes, I would 

### Technological Results:
Performance Requirement | Outcome
------------ | -------------
Was the customer data stored safely? | Yes
Did it manage the call flow rate? | Yes
Did it match the customer with the appropriate RM? | Yes
Did it successfully redirect customers to an interactive voice response unit when needed? | Yes
Ability to route calls (reduction in pre-call handling time)? | Yes

# Assumptions
We assumed that:
* All significant company stakeholders are willing to implement the information system
* The travel company has the funds and resources needed to successfully integrate the system
* Customers are distinguished by outbound and inbound calls
* Holiday package payments are made through the information system  
* A long waiting time is anything over 10 mins (Customers hang up the phone after 10 minutes)
* The travel companies current requirements are constant and do not change throughout the duration of the project

# Competitive Advanatages and their Problems
To gain a competitive advantage in the travel industry, ensuring the implementation of sophisticated and efficient systems is critical for allowing businesses to deliver effective outputs. Increasing efficiency of operations will allow the travel company and its stakeholders to anticipate a profitable growth, whilst maintaining lower expenses. By doing this, it will increase their overall competitive advantage in the market.

Competitive Advantages:
* Ensuring accurate financial reports are conducted (annually, half-yearly, monthly) 
* Automation system that creates RM profiles in less than 10 minutes.
* Highly sophisticated and efficient call systems are put into place to avoid miscommunication


The Business will face adverse impacts if the information system project fails. This can be due to an incorrectly defined project scope and imperfect risk management. Consequences of the project failure include:
* Substantial loss of finance and assets
* Poor business reputation 
* Dismissive feedback by disappointed customers - negative online reviews leading to loss of customers
* Most if not all stakeholders involved will be unhappy and deeply affected by the project failure.
* Possible business closure 
* Inaccurate financial reporting
* Not adhering to the main set of the business requirements 
* Unwanted exposure to news and online platforms for system failure

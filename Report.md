# Objectives

The analysis will allow the Relationship Managers (RM) to ensure fulfilment of objectives as stated by the demands of the travel company. Objectives are outlined as follows:

* Develop an information system to improve the operation on their in-house Call Management Centre (CMC)

* Adjust the call flow rate to suitable Relationship Managers (RM) in order to perform sales (holiday packages)

* Match RMs and end-customers according to RMs skills, performance, product knowledge and customers profiles

* Create a target list for each RM based on their skills and profile

* Provide improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for both inbound and outbound calls 

* Ensure the targeting of potential buyers with outbound calls are accurate 

* Segmenting customers into social and cultural segments according to their postcodes and surnames (Utilising the ‘Profiler Tool’)

* Able to create RM profiles; Using the employment 10-minute questionnaire data that is stored

* Ability to route calls, minimising inbound call costs (reducing pre-call handling time) 

* Generate a customer score (Rating of: 1-10), capturing and utilising data such as ‘repeated customers’, ‘postcodes’ to adjust scores

* Ability to redirect customers to an interactive voice response unit during large call inflows

______________________________
# Define the problem
* The system’s operation is complicated by the varying number and nature of holiday packages offered by the travel company. 

* Customers may hang up the phone if they suffer from a longer wait time than expected.

* Misaligned expectations: Stakeholders might have different visions as to what the software capabilities are. 

* Data Integrity: Ensuring that privacy standards are upheld (No leaking customers personal information).

* Short term decline in productivity during the software implementation stage. Thus, the staff could find it hard to adjust to a new system initially. 

_______________________________
# Stakeholders
* Call management Centre (CMC): Main source of transactions and communication. Customer retention and getting new customers 

* Relationship Managers (RM): They ensure sales are performed and ensure continuous transactions are completed. Generate as many sales of holiday packages as possible

* Current customers: Have a vested interest and potential stake in the company. They purchase products through the travel company. The information system will provide assistance to RMs in serving their potential customers and will match RMs and potential customers according to RMs skills and customer profiles. 

* Holiday Suppliers: They are stakeholders as it is their product being sold. The call centre is just the intermediary, therefore they have a vested interest.

# Approach to Design Thinking principles
## Empathise 
Empathise is the first stage of design thinking, gaining an empathetic understanding of the problem our group is attempting to solve. Gaining a deeper understanding of the user will promote the success of the information system implementation, adhering to stakeholder expectations.  In order to achieve this, our group designed an empathy map. Please see below:

### Think & Feel
* Fear of the information system not meeting CMC requirements
* Excitement, RMs get a better system which makes work easier/more efficient
* Nervous to learn how to information works, might be confronting

### Hear
* Heard that other travel companies (competitors) might have a similar system
* Heard that improvements in information systems can boost sales and revenue
* Heard that IT can be tough to learn but is an opportunity to develop new skills

### See
* See customers being unfamiliar with the new system
* See a more efficient call flow rate, RMs performing more sales
* See competitors trying to emulate the company’s new system

### Say & Do
* I want a reliable system that will not need constant maintained
* I don’t understand how the system works and will need to be trained
* I envision the system to a great success, leading to a greater customer experience

### Pain
* The implementation of a new system could be very expensive
* If the system fails, our customers might go to our competitors
* Our customers might not like the new system, and would rather use old one 

### Gain
* Gain a competitive advantage in the travel market  
* Ability to measure RM performance which can be used to monitor employees
* Workers perform more efficiently, selling more products which promotes company profits

## Define 
### Point of View Table
User| Needs | Insight 
-------------|-------------|---------------
Call management Centre (CMC) | As part of the CMC I need correct information on each customer and the relationship managers/their profiles.</br></br>As the CMC we need to correctly store customer call metadata to ensure customers are routed appropriately. | Without proper RM profiles or customer data the CMC can not route to the most effective salesman.</br></br></br>Correct call history will allow RM’s to more efficiently help customers and sell holiday packages.
Relationship Managers (RM) | As a RM I need proper customer routing from the profiler tool so that I know what my customer wants when they connect to me.</br></br>As an RM I need current updates on different holiday packages to ensure that holiday packages are not overbooked. | Relationship Managers will be more efficient if the customer’s profiles match the specific RM’s profile allowing them to help the customers more.</br></br>Incorrectly stored holiday packages may cause damage repayments for the travel company.
Customers | As a customer I need comprehensive call instructions and quick routing so I don’t have to wait long on the phone.</br></br>As a customer I need clear call connection so I can understand the information given to me. | Customers are more inclined to purchase packages if their experience with the call service is easy and quick.</br></br>Customers who find the RM hard to understand are less inclined to listen and therefore by products.


### How Might We Statements:
* How might we develop and implement an information system that will improve the in-house call management centre’s sales by 15%
* How might we minimise the cost of labour through the information system
* How might we improve the customer’s overall experience with the travel company
* How might we ensure that customer personal data is encrypted/safe
* How might we guarantee that the RM know how to use and operate the new information system

## Ideate 
### WE MET . . . 
* A call centre that was unorganised and overwhelmed with the call flow rate of customers

### WE WERE SURPRISED TO NOTICE . . . 
* The the relationship managers were not matched to the customers correctly (Based on the RM’s skill level and RM profile)

### WE WONDER IF THIS MEANS . . . 
* That there is an opportunity to improve holiday package sales by matching the customers and RMs through a skill matcher

### IT WOULD BE GAME-CHANGING TO . . . 
* Make several day-to-day responsibilities automated through the information system. This would improve the company’s efficiency, so the RMs can have a greater focus on the customer

## Prototype 
(ADD PROTOTYPE IMAGE HERE - UI DESIGN)

# Agile Methodology
Agile methodologies assisted with the project in areas such as requirements gathering, scheduling, communication and design. Our team emphasised the importance of agile values such as common focus, collaboration and self-organisation. We engaged in continuous team communication and continuous integration through the use of GitHub. In particular, our team utilised the scrum methodology.

## Scrum

### Scrum Roles:
Role | Description | Team Member(s)
-----|-------------|------
Product owner | Responsible for managing backlog and monitors project against stated goals and financial vision | Giora Glick
Scrum master | Facilitates the scrum, ensures scrum is understood and enacted | Cody Fisher-Peel
Development team | Responsible for developing incremental releases and are autonomous | Jack Hennessy, Jordan Besser

### Scrum Events:
#### Sprint
Our team utilised sprints to develop our report. We had multiple iterations to improve the quality of our report as evidenced by the GitHub updates. 

#### Sprint planning
Created the backlog and the goal of the sprint (to complete our assignment). Took half a day. Frequent and fluid communication was of value here, as it was important all team members were working towards a common goal and understood their individual tasks.

#### Sprint review
Completed after each iteration. Used to examine what has been created after each sprint and to view progress. After our first sprint review we concluded the report should be moved from Google Docs to GitHub. The second sprint review was used to improve the formatting of our report and identify any remaining questions. 

#### Sprint retrospective
Final event of the sprint where the team examines how they are working and looks for ways to improve. During our retrospective we acknowledged our communication had been highly effective, however identified our GitHub skills could be improved.

#### Daily scrum meetings
We frequently held scrum meetings. During these meetings we each discussed what tasks we had completed since our last meeting, what we intended to work on and any issues we were encountering. 

### Artefacts:
#### Product backlog
A list of all tasks and requirements required to be completed for the project to be successfully developed. Our team found it most useful for our project backlog items to include questions assigned to respective team members as well as other requirements of the project, such as system diagrams.

#### Sprint backlog
A table of product backlog items, often represented physically on a wall or virtually e.g.  Kanban board. Used to track the progress of each backlog item. Items are sorted into chronological columns e.g. not started, in-progress, development, testing, completed. We used a sprint backlog to track the progress of our individual tasks assisting us with completing our project on time.

#### Product increment
Represents a potentially shippable product at the end of each sprint. Our product increments progressed from a Google Doc report, to an initial poorly formatted GitHub report, to a well-formatted and presented GitHub report.

# Competitive Advanatages and Potential Problems
A competitive advantage refers to an element of the business that allows a firm to offer its product or service better, or more economically than its industry rivals. By the travel company employing a new information system to improve its in-house call management centre operations, this will promote the company's overall efficiency. Relationship Managers will now have to ability to perform sales at a more productive rate due to an adjusted call flow from the information system. Enhanced performance within a business is key to ensuring that they are a step above their competitors, maximising sales and shareholder wealth. 

Moreover, the introduction of the new system will support an overall cost reduction for the business. Since the system can automate tasks that were previously executed manually, it will place a greater emphasis on reducing the travel company's expenses in the long term. This is extremely important when considering a competitive advantage, as the company should aim to generate a superior profit margin compared to its market rivals. 

Lastly, the implementation of the new system can promote a higher level of customer satisfaction than other travel companies in the industry. The call management centre will now have the ability to match RMs and end-customers according to their skill and customer profiles. Not only will this further holiday package sales, it will also support a tailored customer experience. Therefore the system will make the business's product and service more desirable to customers than that of its rivals, generating higher value for the firm and its shareholders.    

However, if the information system fails, it can lead to potentially adverse effects for the business. Implementation failure could stem from an incorrectly defined project scope or a flawed risk management forecast. New systems must be thoughtfully implemented into a company as failure could lead to a decreased market share and loss in revenue, contributing to a market disadvantage. Specific consequences of the potential project failure include:
* A decrease in sales revenue
* A decrease in call centre efficiency, leading to increased costs
* Poor business reputation
* Dismissive feedback by disappointed customers - negative online reviews leading to loss of customers to competitors
* Stakeholder dissatisfaction
* Pressure/stress towards business executives 
* A decrease in shareholder wealth
* Possible business closure
* A decline in market share
* Inaccurate financial reporting
* Not adhering to the primary set of the business requirements
* Unwanted exposure to news and online platforms for system failure
